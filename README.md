Each image comes with the underlying codes in a [Pluto Notebooks](https://plutojl.org/) using [Julia](https://julialang.org/). For a detailed guide on how to install and use [Pluto Notebooks](https://plutojl.org/) you can follow this [video](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall23/installation/).

You can find each notebook under the folder `codes`.
